Atomic Strucuture

Face centered Cubic(FCC)
- Additional Atoms are within the faces of the cube
- Aluminium, easier to form

Body Centered Cubic(BCC)
- Additional Atoms are within the middle of the cube
- Steel, harder to form

Carbon is an interstitional alloying material
Nitrogen is an interstitional alloying material
Case Hardening- Carbon atoms get drawn into the surface structure of the metal.
