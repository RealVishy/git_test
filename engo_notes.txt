 Work, Energy and Power

Forms of Energy within Engineering

Kinetic Energy=1/2mv^2

Potential Energy=mgh

Unit of Energy= Joules

Work= Fs= N.m

Power= W/t=Fs/t=Fv

Hardness- Resistance to Abrasion

Toughness- The ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing.

Hardness Testing

Brinell, Vickers and Rockwell 

Impact Testing

Charpy Testing- Pendulum is set to zero and test specimen is placed into the machine.
Pendulum is released and hits the specimen and the amount of energy absorbed by the pendulum is measured.
Helps show level of plastic deformation of the material.

Engineering Materials

Atomic Strucuture

Face centered Cubic(FCC)
- Additional Atoms are within the faces of the cube
- Aluminium, easier to form

Body Centered Cubic(BCC)
- Additional Atoms are within the middle of the cube
- Steel
